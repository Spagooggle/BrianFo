FAU Bathroom Blog	

1/16/26

PHYSICAL SCIENCE BUILDING PS 55

This will be the first entry out of many about the bathrooms in FAU, along with any thing going on in my head. Since I am a guy, this will only be mens bathrooms. Sorry ladies you'll just have to go in blind. Its probably the same so dont fret. I will do these blogs anytime im on campus. Soon I wish to have an interactive map you guys can review whichever bathroom is closest. Idk we'll see. Let's begin

I went here around 1:30 pm on a Friday, only another dude, and he was leaving, so I was gifted a quiet bathroom experience. The last stall I went to had piss all over it, so I unfortunately had to go to one of the middle stalls. Which was fine. Nothing wrong with it. Anyways I give this bathroom only when it's quiet, a 6.3. It didn't feel very clean, the atmosphere wasn't nice cause its squished in what seems to be a spare room. 

With these reviews/blog/public journal, I think I should split it up, with what people come for on top so you can just ignore my thoughts. I get it, I just want to see which bathroom is the best to take a shit in. Thats what I was thinking when I made this, so youre welcome.
